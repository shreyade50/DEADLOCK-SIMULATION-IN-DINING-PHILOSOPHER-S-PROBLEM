# DEADLOCK-SIMULATION-IN-DINING-PHILOSOPHER-S-PROBLEM
This is a part of our course project in Operating System.  

* The report presents a simulation and analysis of deadlocks in the Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic 
concurrency and synchronization challenge. The problem involves five philosophers seated around a 
circular table, each requiring two forks to eat. Through the implementation of a multi-threaded program, 
the simulation explores various scenarios and strategies to detect and prevent deadlocks.
